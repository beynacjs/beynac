# Beynac

Beynac is an early-stage project attempting to port Laravel to TypeScript.

## Status

This project is in active development and not even close to ready for production use. We're focussing on porting Laravel's test suites, documentation and core functionality.

## The name

[Beynac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Château_de_Beynac) is my favourite château in France. It's in the village of [Beynac-et-Cazenac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beynac-et-Cazenac), perched on top of a huge cliff overlooking the Dordogne river. Nearby one can find an excellent bakery, some pretty good restaurants, and slightly too many tourists. Apparently Laravel is named after a french castle too.
