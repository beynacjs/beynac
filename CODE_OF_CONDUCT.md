# Code of Conduct

## Our Principles

### 1. Be Nice to Each Other

We encourage kindness, respect, and empathy in all interactions. When communicating:
- Offer constructive feedback that helps others improve
- Acknowledge the efforts and contributions of community members
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Show patience when explaining concepts to newcomers
- If someone isn't following these rules, gently point it out to them -- maybe they're just having a bad day

### 2. Stay on Topic

Keep conversations relevant to the project's goals.

Mostly this is to respect everybody's time and make it faster for us to identify and fix issues.

There is a side benefit: lots of projects have a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md with a long list of unacceptable behaviors. And yes, in this project it is also not acceptable to poke fun at somebody's appearance, religious beliefs and so forth, because that would be Not Nice, therefore against Rule Number 1 above. But frankly, most ways of being Not Nice to people are also off-topic. We're killing two birds with one stone here. Also, don't kill birds with stones.

### 3. Channel Your Frustration Effectively

We all feel frustrated from time to time. Directing that frustration at specific individuals or at the project in general is not a good way to achieve anything.
- Maintainers: are people always asking the same questions or filing the same "not an issue" issues? Try adding content to the docs or the issue template to help people realise that their issue has already been solved.
- Users: annoyed that some bug or missing feature got in the way of your work? Search the issues to see if it's been reported. If it has, add any missing context to that issue. If it hasn't, take the time to file a good issue, following the guidelines in the new issue template. Or even better, if you have the skills to fix the issue, open a PR!

## Examples

### From a Framework Maintainer's Perspective

**Effective approach:** "I notice this pull request introduces a pattern that could create performance issues under high load. I've created a small benchmark that demonstrates the potential bottleneck. Could we explore alternative implementations that maintain the functionality while addressing these concerns?"

**Why this works:** The maintainer identifies a specific concern, provides evidence, and invites collaboration on a solution rather than simply rejecting the contribution.

### From a Contributor's Perspective

**Effective approach:** "I've been working with this API and found that the current authentication flow requires multiple unnecessary steps for common use cases. I've documented the current flow and created a prototype that simplifies the process while maintaining security. Would you be interested in discussing this approach?"

**Why this works:** The contributor channels their frustration with a cumbersome process into a constructive proposal, complete with documentation and a potential solution.

## Conclusion

By following these principles, we create a community where everyone can contribute effectively and feel valued. Our goal is to foster an environment where technical excellence and human kindness reinforce each other.
