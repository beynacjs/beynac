## Analysis

The analysis reveals several interesting patterns about PR sizes in the Laravel framework:

1. **Large Disparity Between Mean and Median**: The average PR size (627 lines) is significantly larger than the median (94 lines), indicating that the distribution is heavily skewed by some very large PRs.

2. **Most PRs are Small to Medium**: About 60.8% of PRs change 10 or fewer lines, and approximately 82.5% change fewer than 100 lines.

3. **Long Tail of Large PRs**: While most PRs are relatively small, there's a significant "long tail" of larger PRs, with about 13.9% of PRs changing more than 1,000 lines.

4. **Extremely Large Outliers**: The maximum PR size of 23,533 lines is over 250 times larger than the median, showing that occasionally very large changes are merged.

5. **High Variability**: The large standard deviation (1,679 lines) confirms the high variability in PR sizes.

## Implications

- The Laravel project follows good practices with most PRs being relatively small and focused, which generally makes them easier to review.
- The presence of some very large PRs might indicate major feature additions, refactorings, or dependency updates that necessarily involve many changes.
- The median PR size of 94 lines suggests that contributors typically aim to keep changes focused and reviewable.
